🚀 Getting Started (Run Locally)


🧩 Challenges Faced

"What the user actually wants" — that was the real puzzle.
Initially, the site only suggested outfits. But users (like me) wanted why and how certain styles worked.
As a beginner, I wasn’t familiar with AI tools like Lovable or Cursor. I rebuilt everything after learning about them.
The outfit analyzer didn’t work well at first — even analyzing non-outfit images! After several iterations, it now works more reliably.



✅ Accomplishments

Styling tips are logic-backed, not dry advice. They actually teach users fashion reasoning.
The outfit analyzer now accurately detects suitability for body types — a game-changer for confidence and clarity.
📚 What I Learned

“Building a tool for others means thinking like a user, not a coder.”
AI tools can accelerate development, but vision and user empathy matter the most.
Debugging outfit logic taught me more than coding ever could — because it’s about solving human problems, not just tech ones.
🔮 What's Next

🔧 Improve outfit analyzer accuracy with advanced AI training
🤖 Add virtual try-on previews (coming soon)
👥 Add multi-user profiles for saved styling history
🎯 Expand to teen fashion, plus-size, and maternity wear
